## Algo-Viz
Algo-Viz is a **sorting algorithm visualization project** designed to help students build better mental models of how each sorting algorithm operates differently.

## Demo
https://shazi57.github.io/algo-viz-v2/


Currently supported sorting algorithms:  
  1. Quick Sort
  2. Bubble Sort
  3. Selection Sort

## Tech Stack  
I used **React** for DOM-control and component rendering, and utilized **Material-UI** to style and customize most of UI components such as
drawer component or range-slider component. For creating a SVG bar-chart and rendering animations, **d3** and **d3-transitions** were used.

## Installation  
At root level,
run the following scripts.  
```
npm install
npm run build
```  
Then, open the html file on any browser.
